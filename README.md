## Callme YANESL 
Yet Another .NetStandard Event Sourcing Library

## Introduction
This project is a playground for experimenting with .net Standard, async and a simple API for a Sql/NoSql backed EventStore.

Heavily inspired from NEventStore, rewritten from scratch to be simple to learn and highly extensible.

## Learn
The source comes with a [Sample App](https://github.com/ProximoSrl/NStore/tree/develop/src/NStore.Sample) to illustrate some basic stuff you can do.
